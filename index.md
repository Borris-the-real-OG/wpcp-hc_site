      <h1 class="text-primary text-center">Hello there!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Walter Payton Hack Club website! We meet on Mondays during <a href='https://selenium.wpcp.org/'>enrichment</a>, but you can still participate even if you can't make the enrichments! Additionally, even if you don't go to Payton, please feel free to submit your work in <a href=''>Cool Stuff</a> and reach out to participate in events with us (the more the merrier)!</p>
      <h4 class="text-primary text-left">Wait... How is this different than other coding clubs?</h4>
      <p>Hack club is not a space specifically for practicing programming (although you will get plenty of practice through our activities), but rather a community that participates in a variety of cool events such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hackathons</li>
        <li>CTF (Capture the Flag) / Cybersecurity competitions</li>
        <li>Competitive Programming (<a href='http://www.usaco.org/'>USACO</a>, <a href='https://codeforces.com/'>Codeforces</a>)</li>
        <li><a href='https://www.codeday.org/'>CodeDay</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-primary text-left">Can you help me with my CS homework?</h4>
      <p>Hack club is a place for learners of all levels, but we focus on skills usually not covered in the CS classes offered at Payton. Of course, all of our members would be happy to answer any questions you might have, but you would probably find 'Get Coding!' or teacher office hours to be more pertinent to your problem.</p>
      <h4 class="text-primary text-left">This website is a bit... uh...</h4>
      <p>Shoddy? You betcha! That's because <b>this website is a work in progress!</b> I'm really quite bad at anything web-related, so please feel free to pitch in and make changes at our <a href= "{{ site.repo }} ">repo</a>.</p>
