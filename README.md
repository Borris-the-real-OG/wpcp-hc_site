# WPCP Hack Club Website

This is mainly used to help people learn Git, but also serves as a nice collection of things for hack club members.

That's the whole point of this project! Mess up! Accidentally add large files to the commit history (which George already did)! Learn from experience that force push is a bad idea! It took me a long time to get comfortable for using Git personally, let alone commit to other people's projects.
